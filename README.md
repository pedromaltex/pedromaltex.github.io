## Description:
The **Investment Portfolio Manager** is a web application that allows users to manage their stock investments efficiently. This platform provides real-time stock data, portfolio tracking, and transaction history while integrating advanced features such as stock predictions and interactive charts. The project was developed as part of CS50â€™s final project, showcasing proficiency in web development, finance APIs, and database management.

## Features:
- **User Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and securely manage their investment portfolio.
- **Portfolio Management**: Users can buy and sell stocks, view their current holdings, and track gains/losses.
- **Stock Lookup**: Real-time stock data retrieval using Yahoo Finance API.
- **Transaction History**: A detailed log of all buy/sell transactions.
- **Interactive Charts**: Users can visualize stock performance over different timeframes.
- **Deposit Funds**: Users can add virtual money to their portfolio.
- **Market News (Upcoming)**: A dedicated page to display financial news (not implemented yet).
- **Stock Price Prediction (Upcoming)**: Integration with a machine learning model to predict stock trends (not implemented yet).

## File Structure:
- `app.py`: The core Flask application handling routes, authentication, and database interactions.
- `helpers.py`: Contains utility functions like `lookup()` for retrieving stock data and `usd()` for formatting currency.
- `finance.db`: SQLite database storing user information, portfolio details, and transaction history.
- `templates/`: Contains HTML templates for the web interface, including:
  - `index.html`: Main dashboard displaying portfolio and stock charts.
  - `quote.html`: Page to search for stock prices.
  - `buy.html`: Page for purchasing stocks.
  - `sell.html`: Page for selling stocks.
  - `history.html`: Displays transaction history.
  - `register.html`: User registration page.
  - `login.html`: User login page.
  - `deposit.html`: Allows users to add funds.
- `static/`: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and image assets.

## Design Choices:
- **Flask Framework**: Chosen for its simplicity and efficiency in handling web applications.
- **SQLite Database**: Used for ease of deployment and integration with Flask.
- **Yahoo Finance API**: Provides real-time stock data.
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Ensures user security and persistence across sessions.
- **JSON for Data Storage**: Used in session management and API responses.

## Challenges and Future Improvements:
1. **Graph Issues**: The main graph on the homepage is not displaying S&P 500 data correctly. Further debugging is needed.
2. **Stock Prediction Feature**: Integration with a machine learning model is pending.
3. **Market News Section**: Yet to be implemented.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Currently, some database queries can be optimized for faster performance.

This project demonstrates key concepts in web development, financial APIs, and database management, making it a valuable tool for users interested in tracking and managing their investments. Future enhancements will include AI-based stock predictions and integration with live news feeds to provide a comprehensive investment management platform.
